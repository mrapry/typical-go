# Typical Go

Build Automation For Golang
- Alternative for [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) (a.k.a makefile)
- Framework-based Build Tool (No DSL)
- Supporting Java-like annotation for code generation

## Install

```
$ go install github.com/typical-go/typical-go
```

## Usage

Run build-tool for project in working directory
```
$ typical-go run
```
```
Typical Build

Usage:

  ./typicalw <command> [argument]

The commands are:

  test, t      Test the project
  compile, c   Compile the project
  run, r       Run the project in local environment
  release      Release the project
  clean        Clean the project
  examples, e  Test all example
  help, h      Shows a list of commands or help for one command

Use "./typicalw help <topic>" for more information about that topic
```

Check help for argument documentation
```
$ typical-go help run
```

## Wrapper 

The wrapper that invoke download typical-go and execute it. This is the recommendation way to use typical-go.
```
$ ./typicalw

```

Create wrapper through setup command
```
$ typical-go setup
```

## Typical Build

Typical-build located in `tools/typical-build` contain the project descriptor

```go
package main

import (
   "fmt"

   "github.com/typical-go/typical-go/pkg/typgo"
)

var descriptor = typgo.Descriptor{
   ProjectName:    "custom-command",
   ProjectVersion: "1.0.0",

   Cmds: []typgo.Cmd{

      // compile
      &typgo.CompileCmd{
         Action: &typgo.StdCompile{},
      },

      // run
      &typgo.RunCmd{
         Before: typgo.BuildSysRuns{"compile"},
         Action: &typgo.StdRun{},
      },

      // clean
      &typgo.CleanCmd{
         Action: &typgo.StdClean{},
      },

      // ping
      &typgo.Command{
         Name: "ping",
         Action: typgo.NewAction(func(c *typgo.Context) error {
            fmt.Println("pong")
            return nil
         }),
      },
   },
}

func main() {
   typgo.Start(&descriptor)
}
```

## Annotation

Typical-Go support java-like annotation (except the parameter in [StructTag](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-struct-tags-in-go) format) for code-generation purpose.

```go
// @mytag (key1:"val1" key2:"val2")
func myFunc(){
}
```

## Examples

Typical-Go using itself as build-tool which is an excellent example. For other examples:
- [x] [Hello World](https://github.com/typical-go/typical-go/tree/master/examples/hello-world)
- [x] [Use Dependency Injection](https://github.com/typical-go/typical-go/tree/master/examples/use-dependency-injection)
- [x] [Mock Command](https://github.com/typical-go/typical-go/tree/master/examples/mock-command)
- [x] [Custom Build-Tool](https://github.com/typical-go/typical-go/tree/master/examples/custom-build-tool)
- [x] [Custom Command](https://github.com/typical-go/typical-go/tree/master/examples/custom-command)
