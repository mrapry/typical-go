A Build Tool (+ Framework) for Golang. <https://typical-go.github.io/>

## Introduction

Typical-Go provides levels of abstraction for build/compile the (golang) project. The unique about Typical-Go is it use go-based descriptor file rather than DSL which is making it easier to understand and maintain.

You can use Typical-Go as:
- Framework to create custom build-tool
- Golang build-tool
- Build-Tool as a framework 

## Build-Tool As A Framework (BAAF)

Build-Tool as a framework (BAAF) is a concept where both build-tool and application utilize the same definition/settings/descriptor. We no longer see build-tool as a separate beast with the application but rather part of the same living organism. This is only possible because the app, build-tool, and descriptor speak with the same tongue.

## Descriptor File

The descriptor defined in `typical/descriptor.go` with variable name `Descriptor`
```go 
var Descriptor = typgo.Descriptor{
	Name:    "configuration-with-invocation",
	Version: "1.0.0",

	EntryPoint: server.Main,

	Configurer: server.Configuration(),

	Build: &typgo.StdBuild{},

	Layouts: []string{
		"server",
	},
}
```

## Wrapper

`typicalw` is your best friend. It will download, compile and run the actual build-tool for your day-to-day development.

```bash
./typicalw
```

```
NAME:
   configuration-with-invocation - Build-Tool

USAGE:
   build-tool [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   1.0.0

COMMANDS:
   test, t     Test the project
   run, r      Run the project in local environment
   publish, p  Publish the project
   clean, c    Clean the project
   help, h     Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --help, -h     show help (default: false)
   --version, -v  print the version (default: false)
```


## Typical Tmp

Typical-tmp is an important folder that contains the build-tool mechanisms. By default, it is located in `.typical-tmp` and can be changed by hacking/editing the `typicalw` script.

Since the typical-go project is still undergoing development, maybe there is some breaking change and deleting typical-tmp can solve the issue since it will be healed by itself.
